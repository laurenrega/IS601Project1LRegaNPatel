# Master Branch
## What is the Master Branch?

- The master branch is the original or main branch in a repository. "Master" is a naming convention and can be edited, but typically this main branch is the one that collaborators push/ merge their commits to when complete. The master branch acts as the main copy of the repository. The collaborators will pull down the master when working on the repository because it should include the most recent edits.

## Example:
- My "master" branch actually defaults as "main"... But it is all the same. This is the default branch that I will merge features to!
