# Remote Add/ Remove/ Show
## What are the Git Remote Add, Remove, and Show Commands?

- Remote repositories allow programmers to easily collaborate on a project. The git remote commands such as add, remove, and show, allow the user to access and edit the remote repository connections from their computer. Git remote add creates a new connection to the desired remote repository. Git remote rm (remove) will remove the connection to the targeted remote repository. The command git remote (show) will show the user their current connections to remote repositories. Programmers will use the git remote commands to push and pull their commits to and from remote repositories.
