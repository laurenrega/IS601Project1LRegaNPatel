# Fork:

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

## Example-

You can use forks to propose changes related to fixing a bug. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Make the fix.
3.  Submit a pull request to the project owner.
