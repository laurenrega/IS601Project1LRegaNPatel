# Push
## What is the Git Push Command?

- The git push command uploads changes the user has made to their local repository up to the remote repository. The user will select the remote repository and the branch to send it to. By pushing the local changes to the remote repository, the other collaborators on the repository will  be able to view and use the changes that the user made.

## Example:
- I have created a new Feature, "Feature3" locally. I want to push this feature to the remote repository. 	
- I simply type git push <remote branch> <my local branch> or "git push origin Feature 3"
