# Branch
## What is the Git Branch Command?

- Branching in Git is the action of creating an independent copy of the current repository, so that you can work on a task on this independent "branch" without disrupting the master branch. There are numerous reasons why a user would create a new branch, such as to add a new feature or  to fix bugs. If applicable, once the user is ready, he or she would merge the new branch to either another branch or to the master.

## Example:
- Creating a new branch is quite simple in GitHub. If I were collaborating on a repository and wanted to add a new feature, I would simply open the repository, select the branch dropdown, and name my branch in the section that says "Find or create a branchâ€¦"

![Branch1](/Branch1.png)

- I would then select "Create Branch: (*branch name*) from 'master'

![Branch2](/Branch2.png)

- I would make my changes and then commit.

![Branch3](/Branch3.png)

- Once committed, I would continue to work on my branch, and merge it to the master when ready!
