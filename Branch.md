# Branch
## What is the Git Branch Command?

- Branching in Git is the action of creating an independent copy of the current repository, so that you can work on a task on this independent "branch" without disrupting the master branch. There are numerous reasons why a user would create a new branch, such as to add a new feature or  to fix bugs. If applicable, once the user is ready, he or she would merge the new branch to either another branch or to the master.
