# Clone
## What is the Git Clone Command?

* Clone is a git command that allows the user to create a local copy of a remote repository onto their machine. Therefore the user can manipulate the repository on their device, but the remote version will remain unchanged until the user specifically syncs the changes using the git push command (this will be described in another section).

## Example:
- If you want to clone a git repository, begin at the remote repository, likely on GitHub. Select Code, and copy the link provided.

- You then will clone the repository onto your device using your preferred method.
- Using the command line, you will navigate to your desired destination using the *cd* command
- You will then simply type *git clone* and paste the source link. 
- Press enter and the cloning process will run!
